By the means of this Project, I have tried to display the IPL data in an as creative way as possible.

A list of all the Libraries and Frameworks I have used:

1. React.js
2. JavaScript
3. CSS
4. Chart.js
5. A few libraries, imported from npmjs

Key/Bonus points:

1. I have made a web app in Reactjs.
   I have taken the advantage of te reusability concept of the React Framework and created re-usable "Cards", "Donought Charts" and "Carousels" to provide the User a        brief summary of the IPL data.

2.  I have made a Mobile Responsive Web App.
    The web-app, which I have created has a mobile compatibilty attribute added to it. All the Charts, Sliders and Card Components re-size according to the Size of the       device, etc.

However, since, I had started off late (As I was travelling back home), I couldn't properly go over all the bonus points and couldn't add a few more user interactive features like i) Dark Mode ii) Some more Charts for Data Representation iii) Routing etc.

PS: It was a fun experience working on the Project. And, I hope that Utkarsh gets a good idea about IPL now! :D
